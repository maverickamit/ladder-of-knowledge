So, this question is a philosophical one. A hard one, since there are no true answers. Just like every important thing in life, the answer lies in finding for yourself what you think love is.

While I read a lot of books and listen to authors/ youtubers, I struggle to formulate my personal opinions.

One reason can be that I don't reflect much on the said theories consciously. I let my subconscious absorb the information and figure out. But this way is slower. So I have decided to pen down my thoughts periodically.

So the topic of love, is most important to me right now. The depth of the topic is so much more than I ever imagined as a young adult.

It is most important to be honest to yourself about your feelings and needs. But, to be honest, first you have to aware of your feelings and needs. We think, that by default we know what our true feelings and needs are. But much of the feelings and needs are subconsciously driven, programmed in childhood by our situation and which although were useful for survival then but doesn't serve us positively now.

By serving us, I don't mean an objective way of being better treated. by serving us I mean, not to have some serious conflicts in our own identity, between our own values and feelings and needs. Fulfilling one such unconscious need severely atrophies the other. In this situation, we have to be aware of what is happening and then consciously choose a way of life that will give us maximum happiness according to us.

So this process requires being aware of our needs and what functions do they exist for? And to find out what feelings and needs of us are actually making us unhappy in the long term. Experience and knowledge are both needed to unearth our subconscious drives. But the most important task we have is self reflection. Without self reflection both experience and knowledge won't amount to anything. And with even little knowledge and experience but great amount of self reflection we can progress much further in self actualization than the other way around. The amount of knowledge from being aware of your surrounding, and yourself is a tremendous source of knowledge.

The fundamental truths of life are simple, has been repeated to us thousands of time throughout the ages. It is not hidden in some rare obscure book that you have to find by reading your whole life.

So back to your topic of love. What is love? What is love to me? Romantic love, I believe is misrepresented in our society. The version of romantic love in popular culture is narcissism at disguise. The idea of romantic love is to find someone who will love you for being you. And if someone doesn't then there is no love. The idea is to find an admirer of you, but not primarily to admire someone else.

Also this admirer of you has to satisfy your idea of a person, who is in some ways better than you, to actually be admired. Otherwise, his/her admiration has no real value. Simple admiration by someone you don't respect or admire yourself is not fulfilling. Romantic love is in the end about using the other person to feel good about yourself.

Romantic love is usually not long lasting because it thrives on imagination and deception. Both parties tries to show their best image and at the same time both parties projects their imaginations of an ideal partner onto the partner.

Only with enough time and interaction, we can begin to see the real person. And the feeling of intense high emotions fade. But, many of us interpret this as loss of love. It is only a different form of love, more sustainable and more peaceful.

To navigate this state of mature love is not in our nature by default. We have to learn the art of love for this stage. Ideally this type of mature love is possible to be directed to anyone. And it begins with self love. The condition of mature love doesn't depend on some rigid external criteria associated with the person because with time every person goes through various changes in ideas, values and interests. The condition of mature love is celebrating being human, celebrating knowing and experiencing another person's worldview, to experience their struggles and joy, to come out of one's narcissism.

Loving relationships are only possible when two people love each other independently. As in their love doesn't depend on the primary foundation of being loved back. But nonetheless the other person loves them back. Otherwise the partner who doesn't love doesn't experience joy. Because real joy can not be obtained for long term only from being loved by someone you don't love.

Thus in reality, while romantic love creates the space for two strangers to come as close as possible to "ignite the spark", it is unsustainable in the long term without the gentle addition of mature love.

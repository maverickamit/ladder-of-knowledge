I don't think calling this dopamine fasting is scientifically correct. But let's not go into nitty-gritty scientific details. By dopamine fasting, I mean abstaining from getting quick gratifications thorough out the day, which causes significant distractions. The title's not to be taken literally.



Gratifications can come from short term pleasure and long term pleasure. It is when instead of having a healthy balance between the two, we focus on the short term pleasure more, we get dependent on it so much that any resolve or will power to complete tasks that will be pleasurable in the long term seems too dull. 



But it's widely known that short term pleasures are also very short-acting. And doesn't have depth. Like a drug addict, we can get addicted to pleasure and want more and more to feel the same level of pleasure. 



So, how to get out of this trap to focus on long term goals. Dopamine fasting, i.e. to stop getting quick gratifications throughout the day. 



First, we have to identify which are the dopamine inducing pleasures we depend on. 

Major sources are,

1. social media
2. messaging apps
3. food
4. masturbation
5. shopping



We have to learn how to be okay with being bored at first while doing dopamine fasting. Boredom is not as bad as it is portrayed now. While you are not focusing on anything particular, your mind processes information that it has acquired before and builds neural chunks/ connections for accessing later. So, this can help you be creative and induce creative thoughts while you are bored. 

Also, this apparent boredom will go away if we focus intensely on a task, instead of being distracted by thoughts of preventing boredom that we struggle with, in the beginning. After flow state is achieved while working for a task that demands attention and focus (deep work), it brings a kind of pleasure most people deem of much higher quality than short term quick pleasures. 



So, back to dopamine fasting. How to implement it practically?

First find out how many mindless things are you doing everyday which doesn't bring any significant pleasure, only manages to waste your time and attention. Be completely honest and thoughtful here. 

Do you really need to check your phone every 5 mins? Or your email for that matter? Do you need to snack right now? Drink water instead. No need to share that thought you had right now with your friends or partner just because you can. Write it down if needed on paper so that you can send it later at an appropriate time. 



First, try for a week to completely stop doing any such thing for a period of time straight throughout the day. 

For example, you will do dopamine fasting for 4 hours straight from 12 pm to 4 pm. 



If you are on a computer working, then you can use something like "stayfocused" chrome extension and go for the nuclear option for 4 hours. During these 4 hours, you can do anything except for the things you have identified as your quick source of dopamine. 



Better yet, see if this is something that you are working on can be done without access to a computer(e.g. printing your notes). In that case, shut off your computer. 



Suppose you keep continuing this and increasing the hours of dopamine fasting with time. In that case, you'll notice you are being distracted less and working more on cognitively demanding tasks, such as writing, painting, studying, coding etc.



Let me know what you think and if this helped you. 



I am practising this myself and attest that it's been beneficial.

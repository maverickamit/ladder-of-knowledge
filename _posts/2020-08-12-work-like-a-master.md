I'll start off with a quote from Karma-yoga by Swami Vivekananda.
"The whole gist of this teaching is that you should work like a master and not as a slave; work incessantly, but do not do slave's work."

I'll be honest. I have always been lazy since childhood. Be it in physical work or mental work, I tried my best to not put too much effort it. But now, at 26 years old age, I have to face the reality that working is as essential to happiness as thinking and meditating about your emotions. of course, the quality and type of work will significantly influence your mental state. We should always strive to do only the things that push us forward in psychological and philosophical growth.

Many wrongly believe that as long as they haven't found their life's passion, they don't want to work hard. But passion can't be figured out by thinking alone. Action and emotion are so deeply connected that without working hard on something, you will never understand if you love it or not.

I personally don't believe in narrowly defined passions in life. As an absurdist and existentialist, I don't believe we had any predefined passions that we have to find out. Instead, passion can be developed. As long as the work fulfils your highest values in life, and challenges you to grow your character, then it can become a passion of yours if you explore it deep enough and work hard to achieve mastery over the skills.

Every human being has a will to power. The innate urge to immortalize themselves through creation. The natural urge to exert their forces unto the world and see changes outside of themselves. Just by thinking alone and meditating and self-introspection, this urge won't be satisfied. We will need to balance these two aspects of ourselves for a better life. The focus inward to understand your needs, emotions. The focus outward to create.

Now, while choosing to work, it's essential to keep in mind, to work like a master. The difference between working like a master and a slave is that working like a master will make you feel happy after a day of hard work. Because you are working through freedom, the work is not forced upon you. You are working because you have decided you want to and because it makes you happy to work to reach a goal that you have set for yourself.

Of course, it's not wise to expect you will feel happy every moment to work, but short term emotions should not deter you from the goal you have decided to pursue. The difference between a great man and a normal person is that the great man doesn't stop working when he is merely bored or doesn't feel like working in the middle of the work.

If you don't feel like working on the goal consistently, day after day like for a month then, of course, you should reevaluate your goals and choose something else instead. The idea is not to torture yourself, but also to not give in to every little thoughts and emotion that come into your mind.

I'll end with a quote from Albert Camus, one of my most favourite philosophers. "Without work, all life goes rotten. But when work is soulless, life stifles and dies."

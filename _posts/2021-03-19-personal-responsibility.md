What is personal responsibility? It is, taking responsibility for our actions. It is taking responsibility for things in our life that are under our control.

**Personal responsibility means accepting that we have control over our actions.**

That is, we may act some specific way because of being triggered by unconscious trauma, but even then we are choosing to act in that way. We have seen some instances where if the fear of repercussion is high or if the reward is high, we don't act in such a way even when we are triggered. So, we do have control. And therefore, since actions are under our control, we also have to ability to change our actions . At first it will be hard to change our actions under strong emotional turmoil against it, but it is indeed possible.

If instead we deny responsibility, then it means we are saying that we don't have any control over our actions. And so, we can not change it because we don't control it. This thinking process will never lead to growth and maturity. Assuming free will exists, then everything we are doing is by our own will. No one else or thing is capable of forcing us to do something against our will.

_“Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.” - Victor Frankl_

As an adult, we are responsible for our actions. We always have a choice. For example, we choose to stay ignorant about self awareness. We choose to not learn until the situation is so painful that we have to find out what is happening. Self awareness doesn't come suddenly. We have to be willing to seek it. And that willingness is in our control. Without that "willingness", no one else can force us to be self aware. We can always choose to not think about it even if all information is presented and available readily. So self awareness can only start after we take responsibility for being unaware.

To err is to human. No one is perfect. Taking personal responsibility is the first step to realize we have the power to direct our life, to work towards growth. It is to own our mistakes instead of shifting the responsibility to someone else. But at the same time, we have to realize personal responsibility doesn't equate to self blame either. We can forgive our self and at the same time accept that what we did was not being forced by anyone else but our own choice.

Go through this paper for a discussion on responsibility without blame for treatment of patients with personality disorders. It can also help to we to take responsibility without self blame and to hold others responsible for their actions but not blaming them. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3272423](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3272423/).

The path to self awareness is indeed very hard and we are bound to make mistakes along the way. But undertaking this journey is the most fruitful activity towards happiness and internal peace.

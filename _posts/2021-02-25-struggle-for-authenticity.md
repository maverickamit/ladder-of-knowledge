I lack authenticity. I lack being authentic, in my actions. Anxiety makes me worried about how others will perceive me and most of the time I am not being authentic. I am tweaking myself and my actions to fit not being judged too harshly or to feel not to be thought of as peculiar by society. I have a very weak ego, not a strong identity and I get swayed by others opinions and values.

I care a lot about what others think about me. I care a lot about not being seen as an outcast or being laughed at. These things don't make me express myself authentically.

I want to express my feelings and my identity authentically, I want to do actions that align with my idea of being strong and authentic in fully expressing myself.

If you think about it, the great minds of our time, they did absolutely unconventional things at their time. And only now in hindsight, we are worshipping them. But someone like Swami Vivekananda faced so much ridicule and poverty and opposition. It is through sheer willpower he went ahead.

Other people's admiration and respect while has it's value, the primary value is in being authentic. I understand it's hard but you have to carry on. You can't run away from the authentic self. Listen to your authentic self, understand what you really want to do. And slowly but surely start acting authentically in your life. With time, your ability to express yourself authentically will grow stronger.

Hello, I am Amit. I like to learn and discuss about philosophy, psychology, technology etc.

I have a degree in mechanical engineering, although I switched to work on software development. Currently I am looking forward to increase my knowledge and grow as a person. I am also thinking about how I can contribute back to the world in a meaningful way. In spare time, I also write poems sometimes. I really like to travel and have an interest in photography. 

You can reach out to me via twitter or email.
